## Installation

This project is deployed using github pages and doesn't require any installations. It does use some basic jQuery and Moment.js so don't forget those links!

## Usage

When the user lands on The Weather Dashboard, they will immediately see the weather for New York today and for the next five days. The user can enter the name of a city in the search bar located on the left side of the screen. The user's most recent searches are saved in local storage for easy reference and will be displayed just below the search bar. The user will also be presented with the option to clear their search history after making their first search.
